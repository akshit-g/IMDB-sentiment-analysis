# IMDB Review Analysis using NLTK and Keras

This project aims to analyze IMDB movie reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and Keras. By leveraging machine learning models, specifically deep learning models implemented using Keras, the project endeavors to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiment categories.

## Overview

### Kaggle Dataset

The IMDB movie review dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. The dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled with sentiment polarity (positive or negative).
